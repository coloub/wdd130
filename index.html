            <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello my name is Jose Mendoza" width="200">
            <p> My name is Jose Mendoza from Bolivia I enjoy spending time with my family and friends. I like traveling and seeing new places.<br>
                Growing up, I was always curious about the world around me, and that curiosity led me to develop a passion for learning. From a young age, I was drawn to subjects like science and mathematics, but as I progressed through school, I discovered my interests were more diverse than I initially thought.<br>
                High school was a whirlwind of experiences. I juggled academics with extracurricular activities like sports and clubs, trying to find the right balance between social life and studying. Despite the occasional challenges, I managed to maintain decent grades and forge lasting friendships along the way.<br>
                Now, as a college student, I find myself facing new opportunities and responsibilities. I'm pursuing a degree, where I've been exposed to a wealth of knowledge and experiences. College life isn't always easy; there are late-night study sessions, deadlines to meet, and moments of self-doubt. But through it all, I'm learning and growing, both academically and personally.<br>
                Outside of the classroom, I enjoy exploring my interests further. Whether it's volunteering in the community, participating in campus events, or simply spending time with friends, I try to make the most of my college experience.<br>
                Looking ahead, I'm excited about the possibilities that the future holds. I have dreams and aspirations, but I also understand that success doesn't come overnight. I'm committed to working hard, staying focused, and embracing the journey, wherever it may lead me.<br>
                In conclusion, I'm just a regular student navigating my way through life, striving to make the most of every opportunity and challenge that comes my way.
